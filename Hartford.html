      Stars Hollow is a fictional town in Connecticut featured on the television show Gilmore Girls and the Netflix miniseries Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life. It is the town in which the protagonists Lorelai Gilmore and her daughter Rory Gilmore reside. Stars Hollow is depicted as a close-knit community located roughly thirty minutes from the state capitol of Hartford. The original town square set was located on the Warner Bros. studio back lot, just around the corner from the exterior set for the hospital from ER. <br> <br>
        The town of Stars Hollow was founded in 1779, but there are conflicting legends regarding how it got its name. The traditionally accepted story involves two star-crossed lovers who seemed destined never to be together, until separate cosmological phenomena involving stars led them to each other at the spot where the town now exists. This is celebrated annually at the Firelight Festival, shown in the season one episode "Star-Crossed Lovers and Other Strangers" and the season four episode "Nag Hammadi is Where They Found the Gnostic Gospels." Some residents of the town have been shown to doubt this story, like Luke Danes, who remarks it's just as likely the town is named after a hypothetical sex worker named Star.
